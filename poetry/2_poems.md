# Modalities of a Whisper
## February 13, 2018


_Alex Calderwood_

See me

An image. White sand.

Speckled oases nested 

in corneal flare.

Flecks of form in a marble bust,

(a moment, a shutter, a glance of hope)

and the rippling-red artist's curtain withdrawn.

Is it her?

A likeness maybe but nothing more.

With my photos develops an awareness

squinting--I don't share Pygmalion's skill.

 

Hear me

A cosmic standing wave. Resonations

from beyond some interstellar plane

perfused into the moan of a whale,

an aurora's breach, the creak

of a falling tree,

the unsung background radiation of

the observable seas. I will capture her

in the moments that deprecate sight

and coronate beauty in sound.

I tune my forks and I spend all day

looking for a voice in the clouds, cursing

the course timbre of my haggard calls

and wondering if not here,

where she will be.

 

Find me

A horizon. Sails.

Out of photonic waves and into

real ones. If she's just an image,

I'll put her to sea.

I'll seek the breath

of travel and charter

heat, sweat, and strain. 

I'll go nowhere once,

berate the monks

and the tillermen,

and plead them 

for her.

# Abstract Algebra

In abstraction lies something unwholesome,

and I must admit I think there's something

strange about the place a mind 

goes when it drifts away from the where

from the when 

                            to the what

is not known

                         but logical

and

        intractable 

                             and surreal.

# Klein's Dilemma


Homology, sacred geometry--

Topology spins all forms to orders

of rings and sings shape into beauty; with it

strings become knots and knots become numbers,

tangled wars of unsubstance and rumor.


I have trypophobia, and so do most--

the fear of holes that erupt where they shouldn't.

But mostly I'm afraid of getting lost 

in the gaps math closes coldly in logic, to be

moored in shores not anthropomorphic.

What of the voice that sings "Daisy, Daisy?" 

or "Open the pod bay doors."

                                           Says, "I will"?

What of Jean-Louis and his great diversion;

his night at Maud's and women are cosmic

obelisks enough to near the closing curtain.


It whispers, "Choose life! I chose something else."

And warns of a sign above Plato's cave,

"Let no one ignorant of geometry

enter", it said. So now I'm lost in a hall

that bends against logic impossibly.
