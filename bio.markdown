I am currently a Ph.D. student at the Expressive Intelligence Studio at UC Santa Cruz.

Previously, I studied Natural Language Processing at Columbia University while also enrolled in a graduate journalism degree.

I have worked as a writer at CU's Brown Instutue for Media Innovation, where I covered new approaches to journalism. 

I am a writer! I am currently trying to get some poetry published.
