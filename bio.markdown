I am currently a Ph.D. student at the Expressive Intelligence Studio at UC Santa Cruz.
<br><br>
Previously, I studied Natural Language Processing at Columbia University while enrolled in a graduate journalism degree.
<br><br>
I have worked as a writer at CU's Brown Instutue for Media Innovation, where I covered new approaches to journalism. I've also published investigative journalism, designed games, and worked in news automation (turning data feeds into words).
<br><br>
I have too many hobbies! Surfing. Trailrunning. Photography. Installation art. Poetry. Creative coding. Manufacturing. Carpentry. Woodturning... Jack of All Trades, Master of One.
<br><br>
I am a writer! I am currently trying to get some poetry published - 2024!
