Scratch a physicist and you’ll reveal a mystic

they say. In this sense, the author is a fractal magnifier, 

a wide-netted memory device, 

a transcriber of the rote whimsy of finely ordered details and micro-optics

They are a telescope into the empirical essence of upward-down celestial objectivity.

Uniformity makes way to highly intelligent unexplainable fortune 

in the form of opals dotting a black aqueous mass, biologic and suspect.

To inspect is to describe—by the Buddha’s teaching

Refining is reflecting like a seabed reflects 

and is refined I guess

# Reflections of a Dual Degree Dropout
## July 27, 2018

Alex Calderwood

I’ve always wanted to drop out of something, and now that I have I’m kind of sad that it’s all over. In so many ways, last year was the most intense of my life, vacillating between a deep-seated imposter’s syndrome and moments of brand-new clarity, utter reward. I was a member of Columbia’s fifth or sixth cohort of the Dual Degree in Journalism and Computer Science, a program that costs an estimated $210,000 over the two years, factoring in the cost of living in NYC. I want this post to address some of my thoughts about the program: where it shines, and why I left.

 

Little has been written about the degree since some initial buzz in 2010, and few of its graduates have weighed in online, save for a few scattered Reddit and Quora posts. Since the degree is meant to prepare students for a career in either Journalism or Computer Science, they take the entire computer science course-load as well as the entire journalism course-load, five semesters of classes crunched into a grueling four. Students are co-registered in Columbia’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences as well as the School of Journalism, known to its students as the J-School.

 

The program was conceived as a Frankenstein Hail Mary from a troubled industry. It was meant to breathe a bit of life into the school, at a time when Facebook and Google are drawing most of the advertising money away from traditional media outlets, away from, “an able, disinterested, public-spirited press.” At least that’s how it was pitched. In our acceptance letter, dual-degree students are told:

 

Our four-semester academic program will further enhance your training in computer science and journalism, enabling you to create and refine new news gathering and digital media technologies that will redefine journalism as we know it.

 

It’s a clever sales pitch.

 

The price tag is the first thing that sticks out to most people, who wonder how you could justify spending so much for a degree in the relatively low-paying field of journalism. The answer is a bit complicated. For one, every student in the program who applied for aid last year was partially funded by scholarships from donors to the J-School, in varying amounts. And while most journalism jobs have a salary lower than the yearly tuition of this school, the dual-degree students seem to place into well-paying careers, with some graduates going on to work at tech behemoths like Google, established outlets like The Wall Street Journal, and various new-media startups.

 

In reality, few of the students are here to make money. They come to this specific program with varying degrees of disenchantment about tech and the lifestyle of coders. In order to get in to the program you have to demonstrate competence in coding, so they’ve experienced this lifestyle before. They come to the program as multi-talented malcontents, often without clear direction.

 

Speaking broadly, the CS courses don’t address the needs of these students. As a CS master’s degree, it is incredibly restrictive, compared to most graduate CS degrees of this caliber in the country. It requires that students choose from a limited number of lower level ‘breadth’ courses to fill a large number of their allotted classes (such as introductory Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering, or Databases). I’m told that this is a restriction of the New York state government. It requires that to gain accreditation, new graduate programs must propose a set of classes that hold to the state regulatory standards and the school must enforce this list with little flexibility for students who want to sidestep the requirements for classes more appropriate to their future field. And though they cite these state requirements, other CS degrees, such as the Natural Language Processing-track master’s degree at Columbia that I am transferring to, are far less restrictive in the classes in which you are allowed to enroll.

 

For this reason, the program is not well suited for students that come in with an undergraduate degree in CS—they will find themselves repeating classes they’ve already taken. Nor it is well suited for students that come in with a specific CS interest not directly related to journalism—they’ll still have to take a number of unrelated breadth courses.

 

The website that advertises the program, which enticed me to apply one dark December evening, slouched between stale pizza boxes and a recent breakup, makes it seem that it is trying to draw creative-technologists with a focus on the humanities, storytelling, a deep social drive.

 

In the classes, I found little creativity. We spent most of the first semester torn between beat-reporting—totally removed from our domain-knowledge—and a single computer science class that was so divorced from the rest of our days that it was impossible to concentrate on. I was only happy when I was away from school, hanging out with newfound friends (I’ve met some of the most interesting, passionate, and driven people I’ve ever known while at this school) or exploring the city on foot by myself, surrounded by its horrifying grandeur. I was aware that at every moment my thoughts might get drawn to the inescapable reality that I’d made a mistake in coming here, in shackling myself to a colossal debt for an opportunity to come to a dream school that I never could have turned down.

 

The J-School, where dual-degree students spend most of their time and do most of their socializing, consists of a strange amalgam of people. On the one hand, it is an Ivy League school, and all of the students there are there because in one way or another, they can afford to be. The school, I’ve found, espouses social progressiveness but is entrenched in a pervasive conservatism, a sense that certain rules must be followed for order to be maintained. Like the heavy stone the school is built of, and the concrete that holds it in place, things do not give way when pushed. The metal bust of Joseph Pulitzer, the school’s founder, that sits in the atrium, or the statue of Jefferson just outside, remind all who enter that history will be remembered here, that tradition is our guide. On the first day of the required class “The Business of Journalism”, I remember the words of Pulitzer projected on the screen, detailing his desire to never teach business at this school, only craft. His rebellion at once contradicted and sacrosanct.

 

The professors seem yesterday’s rebels, tenured rebels. At the end of the day, many are encouraging to new thoughts, and it’s the structure of classes itself, the narrow bead of what is allowed under the school and its assignment’s strict guidelines, that seems to frustrate so many of the students. Open mindedness is encouraged only so far as it can be controlled. A female dual-degree that started a working group to discuss computational journalism was only allowed to go so far until a professor took it over, dominating it by his ideas, his voice.

 

Some of the journalism students buy into the structure. They are all here because they can afford to accelerate their careers in this way. Yet, they all want to be journalists, exposing truth, holding the powerful to account, with social-mindedness, and expression, and ego and all. I’ve found these students to be full of optimism and a drive to make the world better, but at this wealthy school I’ve found few that are truly radical, fewer yet that pursue journalism for the love of knowledge. At every turn, I’ve felt that information is a tool. When the scoop translates to immediate reward—recognition and return—it has to be. It’s a currency here. I found myself yearning for an artistry in it, a poetry.

 

I think the program, with close affiliation with the Brown Institute and the Tow Center for Digital Journalism, is trying to position itself as a journalistic equivalent of the MIT Media Lab in Boston or the Internet and Telecommunications Program (ITP) here in New York. These are places that take cross-disciplinarily seriously, encouraging rigorous cross pollination between computing, and social sciences or humanities. A few stellar faculty at the school makes it seem that it’s succeeding. Susan McGregor, Jonathan Albright, and Mark Hansen are some of the biggest names in computational journalism right now, and I think they are transforming the entire discipline at a time that serious transformations need to occur.

 

These institutions, the Tow Center and Brown Institute, fascinate me. They are what drew me here. The more I am exposed to their resources, the incredible insight of their faculty and staff, the more optimistic I get about the very future of technology. Whenever I hear people throw in the towel, exclaim that our screen’s dark mirror or our social spiderweb is going to consume us, I think of all of the exceptional work that’s being done to warn us of technology’s pitfalls. I think that if everyone was a bit more tuned into the work these people are doing, the more they’d rest assured that the Cambridge Analyticas, the NSA’s, and the even the Googles of world can be fought, can be defeated.

 

The program attracted some of us for our contrarian nature: programmers that could have had a long (and better paying) career building things, unleashing our creations on the world’s consumers, who decided to go a road less trod, one standing a bit more in the face of the present.

 

I admire what institutions like these are trying to do, a thing so new that it is hard to give it a name. You hear about privacy advocacy, about computational journalism, digital journalism, digital humanities, and you hear descriptors thrown around such as creative-technologist, or a new one that I like, digital humanitarian, to describe the people in and around these new media institutions. No description is quite adequate. Some of the people in this field, people I’ve just recently been exposed to while at Columbia, are nothing short of prophets. I look at people like Mark Hansen at the Brown Institute and others like Glenn Greenwald, or the reporter Carole Cadwalladr, people that live in the world of Snowden, but are less upset about it. I see people that are living a reality at once both distant and near, future and now, intuiting problems that because of their foresight, we may now avoid.


I want to study in and around spaces like these. More than anything, I want to be in a truly free creative space where I can learn to observe like these people observe, where I can learn to contribute like they have. I admire the other dual-degree students who have chosen to stay. Each is working at the intersection of media and technology, doing work that excites me. I expect big things from all of them.

 

But I am leaving. Though the ideas excite me, and the program as it was sold is exactly the thing I want to do, for whatever reason I just don’t vibe with it. Maybe I’m too contrarian, maybe in some way, my desire to drop out is just an anti-authoritarian angst that I would have felt anywhere. All told, I feel like I got a lot out of the year I spent at the J-School, and I know I’ll be able to leverage some of what I learned far into the future. I also know to expect brilliant things from those that have stayed, and those that are to enter institutions like these.

A discordia,

an ill-transmittance

a bang in intermittent space

indeterminate,

undefined

and as of yet unordered

 

withering,

withdrawn

as though it’s been retracted

a passing thought passed-over

a promise of space contracted

 

nothing

not-yet

we’re content to wait

for forms indelible

remain inaudible—happenstance drawn to create

Consume, consuming, I walk consuming,

throw the frail cup away

consuming. In the streets

consuming, I walk consuming

I am consuming, the cup sails

and falls

I sleep consuming, my conscious stream

content, the cup lies somewhere

the tea lies in me unwell, metallic, sick

I awake and the cup has consumed

me, asking why I walk consuming

I vomit consuming and sit in silence a while

damp thoughts like the underbrush of a wide meadow

and the foliage of trees encompassing

a salient calm stare into the canopy

where if I could but move a while, I would see

below the oaks, a consummation, a pile

of cups

waste, consumed

 

wake and the world walks consuming

 

I walk consuming and watch consuming

and turn around and my mirror was,

I’m sure of it,

consuming




#Melt

Did I ever tell you I was scared of you?

This is why I didn't take the kiss

in your apartment, on the night

you called me your best friend in J-school. 

Doubt you remember and

I don't think it was true, the stress

on 'best' was wrong and besides,

what's wrong with you?

You're not cold, but you want

to be ice in a glass of wine,

a glacier in summer

anywhere it doesn't belong.




# On Klein's Dilemma
##May 27, 2018

Alex Calderwood

An entry about my final trip into the colorless void of mathematics and the poem I wrote about the experience. 

 


 

 

Lit by a yellow lamp and white-blue screen, well past midnight, I was slouched over a dozen or so loose brown pages spread over the desk in front of me. I was fervently flipping pages as I hunted for this or that handwritten theorem, which when found, I would mark with a thick yellow fountain pen or copy a fragment of to another disordered page.

 

I was at work on a problem for for a graduate class in computational topology. It was my junior year of college, and I’d long since checked out of the good-grade-game. A semester of drinking Guinness and reading Irish drama in Galway had reinforced my belief I was not the canonical computer science student I once hoped I could be. I would never be able to return with any passion to the land of circuits and 0’s, wires and 1’s that so many of my classmates seemed content to explore. I was a passenger in this world, with an expired visa and no inkling of where to go next.

 

But topology was interesting, at least interesting enough to enroll in the fairly advanced class and spend a few evenings a week (often with a Guinness in hand--that habit continued) in front of my laptop staring at foreign symbols and esoteric images of strings winding into knots.

 

Topology is the study of space without distance. In topology, to contort an object is to leave it unchanged, since contortions only change distances between things, but don’t change their true shape: their underlying Platonic form.

 


An isomorphism between a coffee cup and a donut. In topology, both are considered the same shape, since they both have one 'hole'.

 

 

To add a layer of complexity, topology problems often exist in what mathematicians call ‘n-dimensional’ space, in which surfaces and objects you might be able to visualize as bodies in three dimensions with our normal axes of up-down, left-right, and inwards-outwards become bodies of many more dimensions. For example, a three dimensional bottle might be projected into and then twisted by a 4th dimension. You can conceive of this extra axis as a time dimension, with a spatial movement along the axis translated to an alteration in time, not space.

 


 

A visualization of a cube's motion in 4 dimensions, with the red line representing a dimension in addition to the standard 3 that can be thought of as either a time or space dimension. Click for a more thorough explanation. 

 

 

But it’s hard, for me at least, to increase my spatial imagination to terms of more than four dimensions: 5, 10, 10,000 or n dimensions don’t really make sense in minds that have evolved to reason in three. What do you even call a motion in the fourth dimension? The fifth? Are you moving into something? Alongside something? What is away, what is next-to? You can take a step into the 7th dimension without even getting far from where you started, since motion in any one dimension is the same as walking in a straight line in any of the three we are used to. But how do you get back? Can you step forward into the sixth and then fall down into the fifth and move leftwards along the fourth and retrace your steps? Can you even imagine what that means?

 


A theoretical four-dimensional shape called a 'Klein Bottle', down-projected into three dimensions and made of glass. 

 

 

Working on problems in this space for long seems to impart an oddly cosmic feeling. Maybe it’s because of how strange the universe becomes when you abstract from solid objects with known dimensions, this world you’ve known your entire life. To me, to think this way makes you feel as though you are floating in some fractalized space. Directions branch out before you. To move--to mentally take one path along one axis--will plop you a little further along in what is functionally the same mental space: another decision point of infinite more directions along an unknowable infinity of further paths, branches into n.

 

A key idea in the field of topology is homology, structural parallels in unlike spaces, such as those between our 3 dimensions and that higher-order, n dimensional space. Homology is focused on finding holes--literal holes--in objects, with the idea being that a similar number of holes between two objects indicates a structural similarity.

 

I was working on a homology problem that night when I experienced something I’ve never felt before when working in mathematics. Fear.

 

I was trying to prove an isomorphism between two functions, a mathematical process that required formally defining how many holes either of two objects could possibly have given certain constraints. I checked a few equations and combined them to draw up a new one. An equation that set two complicated terms on either side of an equal sign. With a single gliding motion of the pen, I reduced the term on the right by drawing a line straight through all but one variable: n.

 

Lowercase n, with arbitrary value. The number of dimensions of the space.

 

I was done. The equation represented the shape of the mathematical object I was describing, now known to be of order n. What I had proved was that this shape could have an arbitrary number of holes.

 

An infinity of holes on an infinite dimensional abstract form, seemingly hidden beneath its surface simply by my inability to reason in more than three dimensions. I couldn’t possibly imagine what this shape looked like, where the cavities came from, where they went. Tunnels boring into the limits of my reason.

 

I capped my pen, gazed into the darkness of the room around me, realizing just how alien the thoughts themselves were.

 

I remember feeling, as I was mentally swimming in these n-dimensions, that I would never want to actually go to this otherworldly space of impossible branching dimensions and examine its holes.

 

A few hours of work later, I submitted the assignment and began writing, not able to let this strange feeling go. I remembered encountering the subreddit /r/trypophobia a week earlier, and thinking it fit in oddly well with the feeling I was now attempting to describe. It is a mystifyingly horrific corner of the internet, where people post images of holes in places they didn’t expect to find holes. And it’s oddly creepy. One of the images that stands out in my mind is a real picture of the skull of a baby who died just before their new teeth came in. Their first set of teeth is there as it should be, but just above each tooth is a large cavity, filled with yet another tooth ready to bore out, insidiously lodged in this strange and unexpectedly toothy gap (click here for the image: for the masochistic).

 


 Where does this hole go?

 

I also thought of a movie I had just seen, called My Night at Maud's, directed by a French film critic named Eric Rohmer in 1969, the tail end of the French New Wave. The movie waxes philosophical about whether or not it is meaningful to devote yourself to such abstract practices as physics, mathematics, or philosophy. A character in it argues that interpersonal relationships (in his case, read: sex), and human struggles are more important than any grand discovery you can make in these highly impersonal realms. Therefore he’d given up mathematics entirely. After my disillusion with the hard sciences and my growing desire to do something literary, human, this idea reverberated with me. For the longest time, I've had a lingering feeling that I give up some part of my humanity when I work in math, becoming something more ethereal, something intellectually alien: different from those who only think in terms of concrete shape, color, and mass. I also think that it's fair to look at engineers and mathematicians and realize that they've sacrificed a study of social norms for their study of what seems a different universe, a more basic universe, but one less primal to our nature. Nevertheless, I had solved the problem and turned it in sometime in the small hours of the morning, glad that I could solve a problem I'd been told was difficult, glad also that I was done with it forever.

 


A frame from My Night at Maud's

 

I called the poem I wrote about the experience Klein’s Dilemma after the mathematician Felix Klein, one of the founders of this kind of ‘higher order’ geometry (higher, that is, than our three dimensions). I wondered if he’d ever felt this fear as well.

 

I referenced a few other films in the poem (2001, prominently), all of which grapple with the conflict between the cold abstract universe and the human pursuit of meaning. I also tried to put my spin on a few references to Plato's cave and the famous quote he supposedly hung above his room at his Academy. When I went back to the poem to edit, I thought these references were the weakest part of the poem--they didn’t really make much sense unless you knew exactly the mind of the writer or you were able to make something else of their odd pairing with the poem’s mathematics.

 

A poetry professor in college, for instance, had one interpretation that stuck with me, one that shows just why poets themselves shouldn’t be trusted as the definitive source of a poem’s meaning. He said the references to film in this poem “open up” strangely and without explanation, just like those holes I’m afraid of. I hadn’t consciously planned this, but I think this functional parallel between the surface aspects of the poem and the ideas I’m really trying to grapple with is why I like this poem more than most I’ve written.

 

 

For those interested, here is a link to the poem. Though I also think I did a better job of this essay than the poem itself. 


#116th & Amsterdam
##March 18, 2018

Alex Calderwood


A poem written upon visiting my future school for the first time.

116th and Amsterdam

 

I wake into the stains of Manhattan,

worry persisting that one of the corner-people

has beaten me to being me

and that they'd done it better,

trooped into rather than trod onto

the breakneck curb.

 

Hear the siren folded in New York's lovers' streets,

the boys-in-blue

tapdancing to it their tepid beat?

Cameras draw. Hitchcock Presents;

A love song in black and white,

the pain of a noir murder-

romance that lacks a beating heart or a strong

female lead.

 

Allusions swarm around the block,

casting their shadows on my tourist's

suggestible gaze. Read the signs. 

Where am I now?

 

116th & Amsterdam. An ark

open to some few from

the tempest's huddled masses.

Restless city, your sheets drape a plight unknown.

This quilt haunts me. Your eyes crackle with light

and I can't afford your rent. 

 

On the corner now I've become the everyman

I can't ever really be.

"Jacques!" I call

and I wake at night.


# Modalities of a Whisper
## February 13, 2018


Alex Calderwood

See me

An image. White sand.

Speckled oases nested 

in corneal flare.

Flecks of form in a marble bust,

(a moment, a shutter, a glance of hope)

and the rippling-red artist's curtain withdrawn.

Is it her?

A likeness maybe but nothing more.

With my photos develops an awareness

squinting--I don't share Pygmalion's skill.

 

Hear me

A cosmic standing wave. Resonations

from beyond some interstellar plane

perfused into the moan of a whale,

an aurora's breach, the creak

of a falling tree,

the unsung background radiation of

the observable seas. I will capture her

in the moments that deprecate sight

and coronate beauty in sound.

I tune my forks and I spend all day

looking for a voice in the clouds, cursing

the course timbre of my haggard calls

and wondering if not here,

where she will be.

 

Find me

A horizon. Sails.

Out of photonic waves and into

real ones. If she's just an image,

I'll put her to sea.

I'll seek the breath

of travel and charter

heat, sweat, and strain. 

I'll go nowhere once,

berate the monks

and the tillermen,

and plead them 

for her.

# Abstract Algebra

In abstraction lies something unwholesome,

and I must admit I think there's something

strange about the place a mind 

goes when it drifts away from the where

from the when 

                            to the what

is not known

                         but logical

and

        intractable 

                             and surreal.

# Klein's Dilemma


Homology, sacred geometry--

Topology spins all forms to orders

of rings and sings shape into beauty; with it

strings become knots and knots become numbers,

tangled wars of unsubstance and rumor.


I have trypophobia, and so do most--

the fear of holes that erupt where they shouldn't.

But mostly I'm afraid of getting lost 

in the gaps math closes coldly in logic, to be

moored in shores not anthropomorphic.

What of the voice that sings "Daisy, Daisy?" 

or "Open the pod bay doors."

                                           Says, "I will"?

What of Jean-Louis and his great diversion;

his night at Maud's and women are cosmic

obelisks enough to near the closing curtain.


It whispers, "Choose life! I chose something else."

And warns of a sign above Plato's cave,

"Let no one ignorant of geometry

enter", it said. So now I'm lost in a hall

that bends against logic impossibly.
