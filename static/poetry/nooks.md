My friends are the nooks
between spaces filled
with hidden meaning
our jokes the riddles
left by our passing
the marks: vines and books
treasures hid as silent
as the waves they watch
the cities built around stairs
cobble but just one missing
notes tucked into cracks
gardens flung where soil lands
corners beckoning the sunlight left
we go right beyond to crooks
find each other in these nooks
