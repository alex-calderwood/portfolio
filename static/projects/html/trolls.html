Working with two of my classmates in the dual M.S. for computer science and journalism, we built a graph database of tweets related to the Russian disinformation campaign for the 2016 U.S. presidential election. We found that Twitter erroneously suspended hundreds of accounts that were owned by everyday Twitter users who had no actual connection to the Russian IRA. For the project, we interviewed executives at Twitter and Congressional aides, and published a story that appeared on the frontpage of WIRED. After publication, the accounts were reinstated, and  Congress was forced to release a revised list of IRA-affiliated handles. Twitter never apologized though.
