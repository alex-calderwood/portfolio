Working with two of my classmates in the dual M.S. for computer science and journalism, we built a graph database of IRA affiliated tweets related to the 2016 election. We found that Twitter made huge mistakes, suspending hundreds of accounts that were owned by everyday Twitter users, who had no actual connection to the IRA. For the project, we interviewed Twitter Executives and Congressional aides, and published a fully-reported story that appeared on the frontpage of WIRED. After publication, the accounts were reinstated, and  Congress was forced to release a revised list of IRA-affiliated handles. Twitter never apologized though.
