<i>In Progress</i>

Mercury is a storytelling companion powered by AI and set in VR. It reads along with you and pairs your book with intelligently currated dynamic visuals. Think environments that morph to match a novel's evolving settings, diagrams that expand a textbook's explanations, or character models that act out a novel in real-time.

I spent a month over the summer building the prototype. I am looking to expand it in the future.
