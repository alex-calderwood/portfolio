During my internship at ProductionPro Technologies, I concurrently worked on a framework for generating poetry with any sequence model you'd want to plug in. The project was meant to instruct other coders how to use language models like Markov chains for poetry.

This repository also contains the code for <i>Semantic Compasses</i>.
