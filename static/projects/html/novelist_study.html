We recruited professional novelists to use AI writing tools to augment their practice, curious to learn if they would discover ways to use cutting-edge generative text tools in ways that haven't been forseen by the CS community. In addition to learning about how to design such systems, we found that AI models can be used to see one's writing in a new light, akin to what Viktor Shklovsky termed "defamiliarization".
