Inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIL9kMJJSc">this video</a> about <a href="https://oeis.org/A250001">this paper</a>,
I set out to address the pressing question: How many unique ways are there to overlap 6 circles in the plane? Working with a grad student at the MIT Media Lab, we wrote some javascript code and realized that the problem is NP-hard. It was a fun computational geometry project though. Our code is <a href="https://github.com/aberke/overlapping-circles">here</a>.
