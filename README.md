Damiano Gui - portfolio
=========
This is a showcase of my main design projects.

*We all stand on the shoulder of giants. The website is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com). I based the home page layout on Nii Adjetey Sowah's [Grid Gallery](https://github.com/nadjetey/GridGallery) Jekyll theme, which is based on Mary Lou's [Google Grid gallery](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/03/21/google-grid-gallery/), which is based the [Google Chromebook getting started guide gallery](https://gweb-gettingstartedguide.appspot.com/). Thanks to [Jon Q](http://codepen.io/ItsJonQ/pen/jzaKH) for the layout basics of the project page. Feel free to look at the [sourcecode](https://github.com/damianogui/playground) and sketches of the [home page](http://codepen.io/damianogui/pen/yazui?editors=010) and [project pages](http://codepen.io/damianogui/pen/IqleD?editors=110) (kitten alert!).*
