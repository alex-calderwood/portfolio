We all stand on the shoulder of giants. I built this website with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) customizing Nii Adjetey Sowah's [Grid Gallery](https://github.com/nadjetey/GridGallery) theme, which is based on Mary Lou's [Google Grid gallery](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/03/21/google-grid-gallery/), which is based the [Google Chromebook getting started guide gallery](https://gweb-gettingstartedguide.appspot.com/).
