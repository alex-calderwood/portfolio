During my internship at ProductionPro Technologies, I concurrently worked on a model-agnostic framework for poetry generation. 

The framework is a basic instruction on how to use language models like Markov chains and variational auto-encoders for poetry.

This repository also contains the code for <i>Semantic Compasses</i>.
