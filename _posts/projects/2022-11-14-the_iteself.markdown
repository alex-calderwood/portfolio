The Itself is a (work in progress) game born of my failure to find a writing game which has moves that closely correspond to the creative decisions that poets and writers actually face. Problems of diciton, imagery, and form are all present in the game.

I hope to release the game on itch.io as a pdf, taking inspiration from Everest Pipkin's [The Ground Itself](https://everestpipkin.itch.io/the-ground-itself).
