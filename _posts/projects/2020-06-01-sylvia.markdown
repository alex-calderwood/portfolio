Sylvia is a research project that explores the idea of building aging into the design process of virtual beings. Sylviaâ€™s Instagram account was live from July 2020 as she aged rapidly, before her departure in November 2020. The project was an early exploration of the co-writing paradigm in which prompting an AI persona (trained on hundreds of thousands of Instagram influencer's posts) led to a coproduced longform text. The text is a jarring mashup of voices that represents a clash between young and old, permanent and impermanent, introspection and pure exterior.
