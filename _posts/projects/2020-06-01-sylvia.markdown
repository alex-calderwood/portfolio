Sylvia is a research project that explores the idea of building aging into the design process of virtual beings.Sylviaâ€™s Instagram account was live from July to November 2020 as she aged rapidly. The project explores the co-writing paradigm in which an AI completes, or responds to, the writer-editor using the tool. Technically, it involved scraping hundreds of thousands of Instagram captions to fine-tune OpenAI's GPT-2 text generation model.
