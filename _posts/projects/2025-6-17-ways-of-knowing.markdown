This is from Taper #14: Sonnets, Spring 2025:

Inspired by Queneau’s line by line writing experience (A Hundred 
Thousand Billion Poems), “Ways of Knowing” tasks the 
player-writer-reader with producing single-word sonnets 
on a character-by character basis. Every reload maps a random 
14-character word to each arrow key. The player is tasked with 
navigating an epistemological sonnet by iteratively choosing 
which character from the four words to next select.

I’ve found the created texts to form potent and quirky neologisms,
and the resulting spatial construction to have a different effect 
as a concrete poem than experienced during its composition.
 
“Ways of Knowing” is part of a larger project exploring text editors 
that peek into or comment on the aesthetics of composition. How might 
the experience of writing be targeted as a poetic end in and of 
itself? How can we provoke writer-players to confront the limited 
plane of authorship afforded by their material circumstances?
