As a creative technologist, I contributed to "Beetle Chat" with the game/art/awesome+weird studio Tender Claws. From the <a href="https://tenderclaws.com/beetlechat">project description</a>:

"Part interactive live-stream, part theatrical performance, part sophisticated narrative AI backend and part live telenovela about the daily dramas of an animal camera as written by its inhabitants: 16 Predaceous Sunburst Diving Beetles.

Beetle Chat was presented as part of OASIS: The Video Game Exhibition at El Centro Nacional de las Artes in Mexico City from May 12 - June 11, 2023."
