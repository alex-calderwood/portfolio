This paper discusses positions taken up by the field of contemporary literacy studies as they relate to digital writing technology. Literacy studies have not, to our knowledge, been sufficiently examined from the world of HCI and writing support. We aim to show that literacy studies as a conceptual framework offers a number of theoretical challenges to prevailing views of writing that underpin writing support technology development. We discuss the notions assemblage and posthuman critical literacy, which may indicate new research directions for writing support technology in theoretical, artistic, and ideological fronts. Finally, we describe a textual instrument that demonstrates these ideas.
