Inspired by a Numberphile video, I set out to address the pressing question: How many unique ways are there to overlap 6 circles in the plane? Working with a grad student at the MIT Media Lab, we wrote some javascript code and realized that the problem is NP-hard. It was a suprisingly rich and very fun computational geometry exercise though.
