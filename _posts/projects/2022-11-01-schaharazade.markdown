Schaharazade is a dadaist poetry writing tool. The user plays a note in a midi keyboard, then the system will write a word to the screen. There are a number of user specifiable proceedures that change how the keys index into the words of the source text.

The project is something of an "irrational reconstruction" of Max Kreminski's concept of 'Narrative Instruments'. The lineage of this idea goes farther back to the writing of my co-advisor Noah Wardrip Fruin, who wrote about 'Textual Instruments'.

In it's current form, rather than operate over narratives, it is a poetry writing tool. The idea: can we adapt music production techniques that are used in Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) to poetry? The project is inspired by Dadaist poetry as well as surrealist writing practices. I would view the idea as fully realized when it allows for expressive performance (cut up / derrangement) of a given source text. I haven't quite achieved that goal but it is within view. 

William Borroughs' THE CUT UP METHOD was very inspirational to me, so I'll reproduce the cut up in its entirety here. 

ALL WRITING IS IN FACT CUT UPS OF GAMES AND ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR OVERHEARD? WHAT ELSE? ASSUME THAT THE WORST HAS HAPPENED EXPLICIT AND SUBJECT TO STRATEGY IS AT SOME POINT CLASSICAL PROSE. CUTTING AND REARRANGING FACTOR YOUR OPPONENT WILL GAIN INTRODUCES A NEW DIMENSION YOUR STRATEGY. HOW MANY DISCOVERIES SOUND TO KINESTHETIC? WE CAN NOW PRODUCE ACCIDENT TO HIS COLOR OF VOWELS. AND NEW DIMENSION TO FILMS CUT THE SENSES. THE PLACE OF SAND. GAMBLING SCENES ALL TIMES COLORS TASTING SOUNDS SMELL STREETS OF THE WORLD. WHEN YOU CAN HAVE THE BET ALL: "POETRY IS FOR EVERYONE" DOCTOR NEUMAN IN A COLLAGE OF WORDS READ HEARD INTRODUCED THE CUT UP SCISSORS RENDERS THE PROCESS GAME AND MILITARY STRATEGY, VARIATION CLEAR AND ACT ACCORDINGLY. IF YOU POSED ENTIRELY OF REARRANGED CUT DETERMINED BY RANDOM A PAGE OF WRITTEN WORDS NO ADVANTAGE FROM KNOWING INTO WRITER PREDICT THE MOVE. THE CUT VARIATION IMAGES SHIFT SENSE ADVANTAGE IN PROCESSING TO SOUND SIGHT TO SOUND. HAVE BEEN MADE BY ACCIDENT IS WHERE RIMBAUD WAS GOING WITH ORDER THE CUT UPS COULD "SYSTEMATIC DERANGEMENT" OF THE GAMBLING SCENE IN WITH A TEA HALLUCINATION: SEEING AND PLACES. CUT BACK. CUT FORMS. REARRANGE THE WORD AND IMAGE TO OTHER FIELDS THAN WRITING.
