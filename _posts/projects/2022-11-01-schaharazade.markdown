Schaharazade is a (work in progress) attempt to take literally Max Kreminski's conception of 'Narrative Instruments'. However, in it's current form, rather than narratives, it is a poetry writing tool. The idea: can we adapt music production techniques that are used in Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) to poetry?
