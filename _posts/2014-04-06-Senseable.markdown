During summer 2012 I worked as a research intern at [MIT Senseable City Lab](http://senseable.mit.edu). I collaborated to the LIVE Singapore! project: 'an open platform for the collection, elaboration and distribution of real-time data that reflect urban activity'. My main task was to design an interactive installation for the exhibition of the project in Singapore.

The challenge was to be able to display a huge amount of data from very different sources (public transport, phone calls, social networks, weather etc.), convert them in a unified visual language, and give users an intuitive way to manipulate them through various calculations. The final output was a wide multi-touch surface.

The project has been later developed into the [Data Collider](http://datacollider.io)
