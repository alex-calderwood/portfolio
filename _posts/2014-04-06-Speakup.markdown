Speak Up! is an application for workers who, subjected to an injustice, wish to share their outrage amongst themselves and to express it to the outside world.

In this time of crisis, when demonstrations are ever more difficult to arrange and succeed in getting their message across, we want to create a new way to allow people to express themselves.
This must happen without intermediaries. No trade unions, no government, no journalists.

This service helps workers to organize themselves, create a big and enjoyable event, and automatically get the result numbers.
It creates something that is impossible not to hear.
