subtitle: Don't kill the bright fish!

Feed the bright fishes.
Kill the dark fishes.
Avoid the toxic ones.
How long will you survive?

 The concept couldn't be simpler: keep a little fish alive as much as you can. There are no levels, no power-ups, no nothing. The only goal is staying alive. Seems easy? Give it a try and then let me know! ;-)

I developed Blue Pond for fun in my spare time, following a hidden passion for game development I had since I was a kid and only recently rediscovered. I spent a lot of time and had a lot of fun making it. If you want to know the whole story, [read here.](https://medium.com/@damianogui/the-making-of-blue-pond-6d56a060120d)

The game is available for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blue-pond/id939850886?ls=1&mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.damianogui.bluepond) and [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Damiano-Gui-Blue-Pond/dp/B00PXQNZOE) phones and tablets.
