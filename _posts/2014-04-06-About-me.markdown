I'm an interaction designer. And yes, GUI is my family name, seriously. 

I got a bachelor in *Modern Literature* because I love reading and thinking, and then a master in *Visual and Multimedia Communication Design* because I love building things. I've been a visiting student at [MIT Senseable City Lab](http://senseable.mit.edu). After graduation, I co-founded *Hic Locative Media* within the [TechPeaks Accelerator](http://www.techpeaks.eu) and designed the [Mapnaut App](http://www.mapnaut.com). 

I sometimes [write](https://medium.com/@damianogui), I often [tweet](https://twitter.com/damianogui), and I watch a lot of movies. More about me on [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/damiano-gui/4a/5ab/b99). Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:damianogui@gmail.com)

*We all stand on the shoulder of giants. I built this website with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) customizing Nii Adjetey Sowah's [Grid Gallery](https://github.com/nadjetey/GridGallery) theme, which is based on Mary Lou's [Google Grid gallery](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/03/21/google-grid-gallery/), which is based the [Google Chromebook getting started guide gallery](https://gweb-gettingstartedguide.appspot.com/).
