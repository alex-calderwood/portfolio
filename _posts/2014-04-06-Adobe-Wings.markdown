After being finalist in the Adobe Design Achievement Awards 2011, me and my team mates were asked to collaborate with LABOR - Agentur für moderne Kommunikation GmbH in the development of a mobile app for the 2012 edition.

The app promotes the ADAA 2012 allowing people to express their creativity in a metaphorical way: "Put your wings and fly" is the Awards' slogan, and that's what the app does.
Everybody can take a picture with his smartphone, overlay a pair of wings on a subject in an augmented reality style and upload his snapshot to facebook. More features will come up later.

Teamwork – my tasks: coding the main functions of the app: camera, overlay, image processing, save and upload process, Facebook APIs integration.
